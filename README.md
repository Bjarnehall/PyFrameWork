We might as well write some documentation. So far we have managed to connect to our python backend, read templates and serve static files. Also extended our framework to create routes dynamically from an array. When items get added the snake_menu gets also updated. So the menu_items array decides which routes exist and which are the main menu links. Next step on that matter is to add even more conditions to this array, for instance to decide to what menu the route/link should go to. Is it header, footer or whatever else?
