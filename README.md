We might as well write some documentation. So far we have managed to connect to our python backend. We have also extended our framework so it creates routes dynamically from an array. When items get added the snake_menu gets also updated. So the menu_items array decides which routes exist and which are the main menu links. 

Next what we should do is to add even more conditions to this array, for instance to decide to what menu the route/link should go to. Is it header, footer or whatever else?
